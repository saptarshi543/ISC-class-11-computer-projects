1. START
2. take input form user
3. execute a loop from i=2 to i<(n/2)
4. check if n is divisible by i from 2 to n/2
5. if i is not divisible by any value of i then n is prime
6. if i is divisible by any value of i then print "invalid input" and exit program
7. to find the reverse of n calculate the n%10 and add to the reverse number
8. update n by n/10
9. Now check if the reverse number is prime or not
10. Repeat steps 3 to 5 to check for prime number
11. if reverse number is prime number print n is an Emirp number otherwise print n is not an Emirp number
12. END
